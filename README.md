It is a game with a multi-agent system able to keep itself in the habitat in which it is found seeking the necessary resources to live and cover their basic needs also they can alter the environment and learn new skills to make its life easier and enjoyable.

The idea is to make the artificial intelligence able to learn new skills learning by themselves and even being able to give that knowledge to other artificial intelligence, and this will include the possibility of getting and store materials and the ability to create and destroy buildings.
